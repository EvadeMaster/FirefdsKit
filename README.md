This module only has features that GravityBox Nougat doesn't have. I've been fixing compatibility issues in GravityBox Nougat and @C3C076 has been merging them into the module.
Most of the features that were previously on the MM version of Firefds Kit are now working on GravityBox Nougat.

This application uses also Root access to apply some Samsung CSC features.

The project uses two libraries:
