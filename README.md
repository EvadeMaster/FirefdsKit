Firefds Kit [Oreo]
====================

Xposed module for Samsung Oreo devices. This was built and tested on the Samsung Galaxy S8.

This module only has features that GravityBox Oreo doesn't have. I've been fixing compatibility issues in GravityBox Oreo and @C3C076 has been merging them into the module.
Most of the features that were previously on the MM and N versions of Firefds Kit are now working on GravityBox Oreo.

This application uses also Root access to apply some Samsung CSC features.

The project uses two libraries:

This is a moded version of Wanam's XTouchWiz:
